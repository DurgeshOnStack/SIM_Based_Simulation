SIM-Based Mobile Phone Simulation in Java
Overview

A Core Java mini project demonstrating interface-based design by simulating a mobile phone interacting with different SIM cards. The project focuses on abstraction, polymorphism, and loose coupling, allowing SIM providers to be switched at runtime without modifying mobile code.

Key Features

Interface-driven architecture

Dynamic SIM insertion and removal

Support for multiple providers (Jio, Airtel, BSNL, Vi)

SIM activation and deactivation

Call and message simulation with network identification

Technologies Used

Java (Core Java, JDK 8+)

Object-Oriented Programming
