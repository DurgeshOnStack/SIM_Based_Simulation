# SIM Card Simulation System (Java)

## 📌 Overview
The **SIM Card Simulation System** is a Java-based console application that models real-world SIM card behavior.  
It demonstrates how different telecom operators such as **Jio**, **Airtel**, and **BSNL** provide common services while implementing their own specific logic.

This project is designed to strengthen understanding of **interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding** in Java.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Simulates SIM card insertion into a mobile device
- Supports multiple telecom operators
- Common SIM operations such as:
  - Calling
  - Sending SMS
  - Internet services
- Dynamic behavior using runtime polymorphism

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Interface** – Defines common SIM operations
- **Inheritance** – Operator-specific SIM classes
- **Method Overriding** – Different behavior per telecom provider
- **Polymorphism** – One mobile device, multiple SIM types
- **Loose Coupling** – Mobile interacts with SIM interface, not implementations

---

## 📡 Supported SIM Operators
### 1. Jio SIM
- Call service
- SMS service
- High-speed internet simulation

### 2. Airtel SIM
